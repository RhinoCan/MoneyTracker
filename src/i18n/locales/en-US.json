      "A new component called Money was created to display all instances of money except where it is being input or edited.",
      "A transaction date was added to the Transaction definition so that users could record when the income was made or the expense incurred. The date is now input in AddTransaction, displayed in TransactionHistory and DeleteTransaction, and both displayed and changed in UpdateTransaction.",
      "The various individual Settings dialogs were merged into a single tabbed Settings Dialog. This was later simplified to an untabbed dialog that managed fewer settings.",
      "Added Sentry so that errors and warnings would be properly logged, reassuring users and bringing issues to the attention of administrators.",
      "Translated all of the text visible (and audible) to the user into a variety of locales and widely-spoken languages so that users could use the app in all of those places.",
      "Added PostHog to track information and success messages for analytical purposes.",
      "Added Vue Router and Register/Login pages so that users could be authenticated and that a given user's transaction data and settings could be kept separate from all other users.",
      "Replaced all usages of localStorage with Supabase."
